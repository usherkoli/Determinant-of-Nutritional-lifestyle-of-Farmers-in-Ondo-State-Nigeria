### Methodology
#### Study Area 

Ondo State, which is indeed a microcosm of the Nigeria nation, is blessed with resourceful, industrious and hospitable people, namely: Akoko, Akure, Apoi, Idanre, Ijaw, Ikale, Ilaje, Ondo and Owo.

In the first stage, three (3) local government areas out of the Eighteen (18) local government areas in the study area will be randomly selected using simple random technique. In the second stage, two (2) communities will be randomly selected each from the three (3) local governments. Then the third stage, will be random selection of twenty (20) rural farmers from each of the communities selected in second stage using simple random sampling techniques. In all a total of One Hundred and Twenty (120) rural farmers constituted the sampling size for this study
#### Method of Data Collection
Primary data will be used for the study. Primary data from the rural farmers will be collected, the aid of an interview schedule. The interview schedule will be divided into sections based on the objectives of the study.
#### Variables & Measurement

Additional Variables: Not specified in empty cells.

### Data Analysis & Preparation
The primary data collected through a questionaire was inputed into SPSS 16 and all variables were assigned values. The missing values were specified as Zero for variables measured at interval level and Not specified for Ordibal & Nominal variables. 

#### Data Extraction, Loading & Transformation
The raw data was exported to Excel 2016 and saved in xlsx format. The saved data was then loaded to Power bi and i proceeded to transform using power query. The data was then Vizualized using Power Bi.

### Hypothesis Result (SPSS 16)
Ho1: There is no significant relationship between selected socio-economic characteristics of 
rural farmers and their nutritional lifestyle.

Based on the results of the Pearson correlation, there is no significant relationship between the 
selected socio-economic characteristics of rural farmers and their nutritional lifestyle. The only 
significant correlation was between years of marriage and nutritional lifestyle, with a Pearson 
correlation of 0.192 and a p-value of 0.036. This suggests that the longer a rural farmer has been 
married, the more likely they are to have a better nutritional lifestyle. However, all other 
correlations were not significant, with p-values above 0.05.

 This suggests that age, family type, 
household size, number of children, years of experience in an occupation, years of experience in a 
secondary occupation, farm size, and average annual income do not significantly influence 
nutritional lifestyle. 

Ho2: There is no significant relationship between sources of information on nutrition lifestyle 
and knowledge of the rural farmers.

The results of the chi-square tests indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship 
between sources of information on nutrition lifestyle and knowledge of the rural farmers, with a 
p-value of 0.953. This suggests that sources of information on nutrition lifestyle do not have a 
significant impact on the knowledge of the rural farmers.
